compatible: "zephyr,hid-device"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  interface-name:
    type: string
    description: |
      HID device name. When this property is present, a USB device will use it
      as the string descriptor of the interface.

  boot-protocol-code:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Device can be used as a Boot Device and supports a predefined protocol
      for mouse or keyboards.
      - none:     Device does not support the boot interface
      - keyboard: Device supports boot interface and keyboard protocol
      - mouse:    Device supports boot interface and mouse protocol
    enum:
      - none
      - keyboard
      - mouse

  polling-rate:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Input type reports polling rate in number of 125Âµs periods.
      Depending on the actual speed, the calculated polling rate could be clamped
      to 1ms or 255ms.

  in-report-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The size of the longest input report that the HID device can generate.
      This property is used to determine the buffer length used for transfers.

  out-report-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      The size of the longest output report that the HID device can generate.
      When this property is present, a USB device will use out pipe for output
      reports, otherwise control pipe will be used for output reports.
